# Notable Tech

- React
- Redux
- Customized Webpack (Not create-react-app)
- Babel
- SCSS/CSS3

# Important Note on Outdated Practices

This application was created using pre-v16 React standards.

During production I have the intention of using older syntax as I learn how to use React from the ground up.

If you'd like to talk about various versions and syntaxes throughout versions of tech, feel free to contact me!  I really enjoy learning how and why languages and conventions change over time.

I also am using Webpack with customized loader settings rather than using create-react-app.
